Showing PHP configuration parameters on Travis CI

## phpenv
Two versions of phpenv exist:
* [CHH/phpenv](https://github.com/CHH/phpenv) used by Travis [Building a PHP project](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/php/) and
* [phpenv/phpenv](https://github.com/phpenv/phpenv) which has more documentation (which may apply to CHH/phpenv).

### config-rm
`phpenv config-add xdebug.ini` does not work after `phpenv config-rm xdebug.ini`.

## PHPUnit
Is not always up to date to minor or major version in Travis, but fairly good. The Travis phpenv version cannot be updated or upgrated (PHPUnit 4, 5, 6, 7). Install PHPUnit with composer for latest version.
